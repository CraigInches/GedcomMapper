Gedcom File Mapper

Simple Javascript and html page to generate an Map of Birthplaces using the
Google Maps API.

Thanks to the parse-gedcom https://github.com/tmcw/parse-gedcom library for
making it so much simpler!

Bundled JavaScript using browserify, which generates main.js, but the logic for
the map is local.js
